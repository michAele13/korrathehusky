    Korra the Husky!

    <p>
        Everyone, I would like for you to meet my sweet little husky, Korra!
        She's not your average husky pup, and she had a tough time before joining our family, but every day she settles in a bit more and is becoming such a wonderful friend.
        If you ask most people, the most identifying traits of a husky are singing and escaping. However, as I mentioned, Korra is not your average husky girl. Her past is a bit of a mystery, but we have theorized that she was a part of a backyard breeding situation. 
        When we met Korra she was about 15 to 18 months old, but had very obviously had at least one litter of puppies, if not more. She was a shell of the dog we know today; just 43 pounds and a mangey coat. The day we met her, we were looking for a dog to save that 
        could get along with my sweet, albeit spicy, old black kitty, Ebby. As we walked up and down the aisle of cages filled with dogs, the sound of their barking, whining, growling and pacing was deafening. However, as we walked through a door that had been propped open, 
        my boyfriend caught a glimpse of a little cream colored pup, just lying against the cage door, food bowl toppled over with kibbles strewn across the floor. We stopped and bent down to get a better look, and she didn't move, she didn't bark or whine, she didn't bare her teeth; 
        she just lay there, begging to be pet.
